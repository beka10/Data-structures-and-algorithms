# Fractions

Complete the following tasks and submit your source file(s) to KATIE.

1. Modify the constructor of the class `Fraction` so that it checks if the provided numerator and denominator are both integers. If either is not an integer, the constructor should raise a `TypeError` exception.
1. Expand the textbook implementation of the class `Fraction` and add methods `get_numerator` and `get_denominator` that return the numerator and denominator of a fraction. Numerator and denominator must be specified as private members of the class `Fraction`.
1. Implement `numerator` and `denominator` as properties.
1. Expand the textbook implementation of the class `Fraction` and implement the remaining simple arithmetic operators (`__sub__`, `__mul__`, and `__truediv__`).
1. Use the provided function `gcd()` to simplify the resulting fraction whenever possible.
